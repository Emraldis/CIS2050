Alpheaus Feltham, 0903594

Test code: Fully functional, see test report (in docs folder) for details on results

File manager code: Not even started, had schedule wrong and started a week later than intended, giving me about a day to finish. Will finish this late and hand in regardless, just to make sure I understand the problem, and the methods required to solve it.

Compiling:
the test code can be compiled using the command: "gcc src/test.c src/binTree.c src/testData.c -Wall -pedantic -std=c99 -Iinclude -o bin/test", or alternatively, with the command: "make all"
the Phone Directory code can be compiled using the command: "gcc src/main.c src/binTree.c src/data.c -Wall -pedantic -std=c99 -Iinclude -o bin/runme", or alternatively, with the command: "make all"
alternatively, both can be compiled at the same time, with the command: "make all"

Running:
the test code can be run using the command: "./bin/test" from the "FelthamAlpheausA2" folder
the test code can be run using the command: "./bin/runme" from the "FelthamAlpheausA2" folder, but is currently essentially nothing.
