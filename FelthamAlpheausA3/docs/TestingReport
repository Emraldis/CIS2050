All testing was completely successful. The tests were run repeatedly, as the testing program generates a tree of random sizes, with random data values. This allowed the program to be tested under a variety of circumstances. Testing repeatedly this way allowed for situations with massive, as well as tiny trees. The program itself also tests for completely empty trees, and how this affects each function.
