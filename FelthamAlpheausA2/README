Test code: Fully functional, see test report (in docs folder) for details on results

Phone Directory code: Fully functional.

Compiling:
the test code can be compiled using the command: "gcc src/testFile.c src/hashADT.c src/list.c src/directory.c -Wall -pedantic -std=c99 -Iinclude -o bin/test", or alternatively, with the command: "make all"
the Phone Directory code can be compiled using the command: "gcc src/main.c src/hashADT.c src/list.c src/directory.c -Wall -pedantic -std=c99 -Iinclude -o bin/runme", or alternatively, with the command: "make all"
alternatively, both can be compiled at the same time, with the command: "make all"

Running:
the test code can be run using the command: "./bin/test" from the "FelthamAlpheausA2" folder
the test code can be run using the command: "./bin/runme" from the "FelthamAlpheausA2" folder

EXTRA:
Includes a program for generating names and phone numbers randomly. To compile, run the command: "gcc src/phoneNumberGenerator.c -Wall -pedantic -std=c99 -o bin/generator", or alternatively, with the command "make generator"
to run, use the command "./bin/generator" followed by a number (IE ./bin/runme 50) this will determine the number of names produced. If no number is added, the program defaults to 100.
