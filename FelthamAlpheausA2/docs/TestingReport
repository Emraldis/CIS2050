All testing was completed successfully. The Hash ADT works correctly (with void pointers as well). It was tested thouroughly, with each function tested when the table was empty, as well as when it was filled with large quantities of elements. The testing file used names generated by the custom name generator program I have included, it can also work using any other of the phone book names (this is simply what I had on hand at the time of testing)
