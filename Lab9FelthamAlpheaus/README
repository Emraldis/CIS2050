Compiling:
the test code can be compiled using the command: "gcc src/main.c src/binTree.c src/data.c -Wall -pedantic -std=c99 -Iinclude -o bin/runme

Running:
the program can be run using the command "./bin/runme" from the root folder.

EXTRA:
Includes a program for generating names, food types and ratings randomly. To compile, run the command: "gcc src/resGenerator.c -Wall -pedantic -std=c99 -o bin/generator", or alternatively, with the command "make generator"
to run, use the command "./bin/generator" followed by a number (IE ./bin/runme 50) this will determine the number of names produced. If no number is added, the program defaults to 100. The main program uses a file generated
by this generator by default, and running the generator will simply ovverwrite the names within.
